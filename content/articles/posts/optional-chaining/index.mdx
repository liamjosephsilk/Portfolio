Optional chaining is a new feature in Javascript implemented in ES2020. Javascript just keeps on delivering, right?

## Why ?.

- Changes the way we access properties on objects that are deeply nested.
- Removes the need to null check.
- Reduces errors if a value is either null or undefined

Say we have some media object.

```javascript
const media = {
  id: 1,
  ensclosure: {
    url: "Some CDN link",
    metadata: {
      id: 12345678910,
      name: "Example",
      type: "mp4",
      duration: 4000,
    },
  },
}
```

Let's grab some metadata, using the chaining operator we are used to.

```javascript
const duration = media.enclosure.metadata.duration

// 4000
```

In this example, we know that the metadata is available. However, imagine this comes from an API where the metadata might be optional.

Normally, we would have to check if metadata is available before grabbing the value we want.

```javascript
if (media.enclosure.metadata) {
  const duration = media.enclosure.metadata.duration

  // duration 4000
}
```

This way, if metadata was available, we would get the data we want returning without an error being thrown. Howevever, if the value wasn't available, we would get `undefined`.

Now, I like getting straight to the point. So wouldn't it be great if we didn't have to use the if statement all together `?`.

## How about this ?.

```javascript
const duration = media.enclosure.metadata?.duration
const item = media.enclosure.metadata?.item

// duration = 4000
// item = undefined
```
