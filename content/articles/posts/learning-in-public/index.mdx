Learning can be hard. Learning is also one constant in life. I have spent the past few years learning web development, mainly front end. We all have our own learning styles but one bad habit I used to fall particularly foul on, is learning passively.

In the community, there are so many great content creators which has made it possible for me to get my first development job. But it wasn't until recently that I really started to push on.

Do stuff.

Don't just _passively_ watch, read or listen. Engage in what you have consumed and build something, write about something. Take what someone has given you and expand on it.

This site is going to be my way to really push myself as far as I can, because writing about something or talking about something really does increase the speed at which I learn 1000x.
