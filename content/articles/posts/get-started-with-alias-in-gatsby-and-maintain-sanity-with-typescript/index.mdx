Depending on how big a project is, React modules can become exponentially nested.

Who even does this? `import component from ../../../../components/component/index` ? And you will probably have many import statements at that.

## There’s a Plugin for that

One of the great benefits of Gatsby is the plugin ecosystem. I mean, there are so many, and that’s just fantastic. I could do this within webpack, but who wants to do that?

The Gatsby alias plugin can abstract that away for us. gatsby-plugin-alias-imports. All we need to do is pass some options and rather than a super nested component, we can just `import component from '@path'`. Better still, if we use an `index.js`, we can export the the public interface and maybe even have something like this `import { component1, component2 } from '@path'`.

Let’s get started.

By the way, we are going to be using Typescript, but don’t worry, Gatsby has you covered. It comes ready to go.

Thanks Gatsby!.

## Set Up

Assuming you have the Gatsby cli installed globally, if not go here and [this](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-zero/) will get you going.

```bash
gatsby new gatsby-alias-typescript
```

Let the cli do it’s thing and then we can get going.

```bash
cd gatsby-alias-typescript
```

We’ve got one plugin we need to install and that is `gatsby-plugin-alias-imports`.

```bash
npm i --save gatsby-plugin-alias-imports

or

yarn add gatsby-plugin-alias-imports
```

Let’s add to our `gatsby-config.js`.

```javascript
// gatsby-config.js
{
	...
	plugins:
  [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-alias-imports`,
      options: {
        alias: {
          "@atoms": "src/components/atoms/index",
        },
        extensions: ["js", "jsx", "ts", "tsx", "md", "mdx"],
      },
    },
  ]
}
```

I really like using an index module within a component structure and use it as a public interface.

```bash
src/
  components/
    atoms/
      heading/
        index.tsx
    index.ts
// rest of structure here
```

## Index

The index file within my component structure will import all the components needed for that module and export them.

```javascript
// src/components/atoms/index.ts

import Button from "./button"
import Header from "./header"
export { Button, Header }
```

Then anywhere in our application, we can import the components utilising the alias, thus making our life that little bit easier.

```javascript
// src/pages/index

import React from "react"
import { Button, Header } from "@atoms"

const HomePage = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <Button />
    </>
  )
}

export default HomePage
```

Much nicer, right?

But, wait a minute. I’m pretty sure Typescript will be yelling at us by this point.

## Fix the Orange

So under the hood, gatsby-plugin-alias-imports does the webpack work for us. But Typescript doesn't know about these paths and will be pretty upset by now.

Let's add our conifg and fix this. In the root of our project add a `tsconfig.json`

```javascript
// tsconfig.json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "commonjs",
        "target": "es6",
        "jsx": "preserve",
        "lib": [
            "dom",
            "es2015",
            "es2017"
        ],
        "strict": true,
        "noEmit": true,
        "isolatedModules": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true,
        "noUnusedLocals": true,
        "noUnusedParameters": true,
        "removeComments": false,
        "baseUrl": "src",
        "paths": {
            "@atoms": [
                "components/atoms/index"
            ],
        },
    },
    "include": [
        "./src/**/*"
    ]
}
```

In our paths, add the modules as needed. This will fix our orange lines of doom and I definitely think this is worth the set up, as
both my sanity and experience increases throughout a project.
